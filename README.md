# Process Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
The **Process Scheduling Simulator** is a web-based tool that simulates different CPU scheduling algorithms, including:
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

This simulator allows users to input processes with their respective arrival time, burst time, and priority to analyze the performance of each scheduling algorithm.

## Features
- **Dynamic Input Handling:** Users can specify the number of processes and input relevant details.
- **Quantum Time Selection:** Required for Round Robin scheduling.
- **Validation Checks:** Ensures valid process parameters before simulation.
- **Gantt Chart Visualization:** Displays execution order of processes.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculates and compares:
  - Completion Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround and Waiting Time
- **Graphical Analysis:** Uses Chart.js to compare scheduling algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend structure and functionality
- **Chart.js**: Graphical visualization of scheduling performance

## How to Use
1. **Enter the Number of Processes** and specify details for each process (name, arrival time, burst time, priority).
2. **Set Quantum Time** (only for Round Robin scheduling).
3. Click **"Start Simulation"** to process the data.
4. View **Gantt Charts** and **Comparison Graphs** for algorithm performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, Multilevel Queue Scheduling)
- Improve UI/UX for better interactivity
- Add the option to export results in CSV/PDF format
